I know I may be young, but I've got feelings too
And I need to do what I feel like doing
So let me go, and just listen
All you people look at me like I'm a little girl
Well did you ever think it'd be ok for me to step into this world
Always saying little girl don't step into the club
Well I'm just tryin' to find out why 'cause dancing's what I love
Get it get it, get it get it (oh)
Get it get it, get it get it (oh)
Get it get it, get it get it (oh)
I know I may come off quiet, I may come off shy
But I feel like talking, feel like dancing when I see this guy
What's practical is logical, what the hell, who cares?
All I know is I'm so happy when you're dancing there
I'm a slave for you, I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I'm a slave for you, I won't deny it, I'm not trying to hide it
Baby, don't you wanna, dance up on me
(I just wanna dance next to you)
To another time and place
Oh baby, don't you wanna, dance up on me
(Are you ready)
Leaving behind my name, and age
(Let's go)
Get it get it, get it get it (oh)
Get it get it, get it get it (oh)
Get it get it, get it get it (oh)
I really wanna dance, tonight with you
(I just can't help myself)
I really wanna do what you want me to
(I just feel I let myself go)
I really wanna dance, tonight with you
(Wanna see you move)
I really wanna do what you want me to
(Uh uh uh)
Baby, don't you wanna, dance up on me
(I just wanna dance next to you)
To another time and place
Oh, baby, don't you wanna, dance up on me
(Are you ready)
Leaving behind my name, and age
I'm a slave for you (take that) I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I'm a slave (it just feels right) for you (it just feels good)
I won't deny it, I'm not trying to hide it (baby)
Get it get it, get it get it (oh)
Get it get it, get it get it (oh)
Get it get it, get it get it (oh)
Get it get it, get it get it (oh)
Get it get it, get it get it (oh)
Get it get it, get it get it (oh)
I'm a slave for you (here we go now)
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I'm a slave for you, (here we go) I won't deny it, (yeah)
I'm not trying to hide it
